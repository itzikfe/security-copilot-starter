The company stored customers’ details, such as billing and shipping addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers on the affected systems. Although the data breach did not compromise payment information, the exposed data could be combined with other details such as social security numbers to create personal profiles for identity theft purposes. Hackers could also use the customers’ purchase history to blackmail readers with embarrassing or sensitive reading preferences. Speculations suggest that Barnes & Noble’s data breach involved a ransomware payload. The bookseller was alleged to have been running Pulse Secure VPN servers with an unpatched vulnerability CVE-2019-11510, which allows hackers to steal usernames and passwords to infiltrate corporate systems, install ransomware, and exfiltrate data.",
